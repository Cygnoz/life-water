# Optional: Configurations for proxying requests to your application behind the load balancer
# This can be useful if your app is running on a different server or container:
#
# location / {
#     proxy_pass http://your-backend-service:5173;
#     proxy_set_header Host $host;
#     proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
#     proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
#     proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
# }
